# Transport Package Test Coverage Summary

## Executive Summary

The transport package currently has **19.7% test coverage**, far below the target of 80%. This analysis provides a comprehensive plan to achieve the coverage goal.

## Current State

### Test Coverage by Component

| Component | Current Coverage | Files |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| BaseTransport | ~85% | transport.go, transport_test.go |
| StdioTransport | ~60% | stdio.go, stdio_test.go |
| HTTPTransport | 0% | http.go (no tests) |
| StreamableHTTPTransport | 0% | streamable_http.go (no tests) |

### Tested vs Untested

**Well-Tested Areas:**
- Basic transport operations (request/response handling)
- Handler registration and management
- ID generation and tracking
- Concurrent message processing (StdioTransport)
- Error handling for malformed messages

**Completely Untested:**
- All HTTP-based transports
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) handling
- Session management
- Batch operations
- Progress notifications
- Reconnection logic
- Network error handling

## Critical Gaps

1. **No HTTP Transport Tests**
   - 383 lines of untested code in http.go
   - 1239 lines of untested code in streamable_http.go
   - These represent ~70% of the transport package

2. **Missing Edge Cases**
   - Panic recovery paths
   - Large message handling
   - Timeout scenarios
   - Resource cleanup verification

3. **No Integration Tests**
   - Client-server communication
   - Multi-transport scenarios
   - End-to-end message flow

## Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. Create test infrastructure (mock servers, helpers)
2. Add missing BaseTransport tests
3. Complete StdioTransport coverage
4. Start HTTPTransport basic tests

### Short Term (Weeks 2-3)
1. Complete HTTPTransport tests
2. Implement StreamableHTTPTransport tests
3. Add integration test suite
4. Set up CI coverage gates

### Long Term (Month 1)
1. Add performance benchmarks
2. Create chaos testing scenarios
3. Document testing patterns
4. Establish coverage maintenance process

## Resource Requirements

- **Developer Time**: 28-36 hours
- **Infrastructure**: Mock HTTP servers, test utilities
- **Tools**: Coverage reporting, CI integration

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: Achieve 80% overall package coverage
2. **Reliability**: Zero panics in production
3. **Performance**: No regression in benchmarks
4. **Maintainability**: Clear test patterns for future additions

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize HTTP Transports**: These are completely untested and represent the majority of the codebase
2. **Create Reusable Mocks**: Build a test infrastructure that can be used across all transport types
3. **Add Coverage Gates**: Prevent merging code that reduces coverage below 80%
4. **Document Test Patterns**: Create guidelines for testing new transport implementations

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this test plan
2. Allocate developer resources
3. Begin implementation with Phase 1
4. Track progress weekly
5. Adjust plan based on findings

---

**Note**: This plan represents a significant testing effort but is essential for production readiness. The transport layer is critical infrastructure that requires comprehensive testing to ensure reliability.
